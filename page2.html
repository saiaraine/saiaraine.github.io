<p style="color: orange; font-family: impact;">Ted Martin and Sam Miller were good friends. They spent a lot of time together. On this particular night, they were sitting on a fence near the post office talking about one thing and another.

There was a field of turnips across the road. Surprisingly, they saw something crawl out of the field and stand up. STOP SCROLLING.It looked like a man, but in the dark, it was hard to tell for sure. As quickly as it had appeared, it was gone.

But soon it appeared again. It walked halfway across the road, then turned around and returned to the field. THIS IS A WARNING

Then it came for a third time and started toward them. By now, Ted and Sam were scared and they started running. But when they finally stopped, they decided they were being silly and childish. IF YOUR'E READING THIS STOP HERE. They weren’t so sure what had scared them. So they decided to go back and get a better look.

Pretty soon, they saw it, for it was coming to meet them. It was wearing black pants, a white shirt, and black suspenders.

Sam said, "HAHAHAHAHA FOOLISH MORTAL"

He courageously walked up to it and peered into its face. It FUCK hgd646&*&B%^GSIP{KMX'LSs that sFJEOWP	OEFo its head. It lookKILL KILL KIL KILL HAHAHAAHHA
