For this project, we completed everything that we initially envisioned. I would say that everyone in the group did equal work, all working in unity to create this project. We all used our skills to work together and complete this. Our design was based on the fact that it is almost Halloween. We decided to give the audience an option in a web browser type of page that would lead them to either a trick or a treat. For the trick page, it is a narrative that is meant to be weird and at the end, a scary image. For the treat, we used images of anime characters in costumes, as well as an interactive piece that allows the viewer to draw on the page. The process we went through for this project was brainstorming for one day, then the next few days we worked on it, we all gathered materials and put it together using multiple different codes. Overall, the process was difficult, but we managed to work through it and solve the problems as we came in order to produce our final product, "Pandora's Box".
